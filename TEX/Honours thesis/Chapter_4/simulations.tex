\section{How to study the consequences}
By studying effect of 

\section{First model}

Gravitomagnetism model. Give quick derivation and show some numerical results.

\section{Adding higher order terms}
Use higher PN terms to improve accuracy. Does this change much?

\section{Numerical relativity}
\subsection{What is numerical relativity}
Explain numerical relativity and why we need it

\subsection{Theoretical basis}
Briefly explain 3+1 decomposition of spacetime.

\subsection{Our model}

Explain what packages we used, and how we setup the model, link code.

\subsection{Results}
