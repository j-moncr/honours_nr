# Before meeting

## Interesting papers
- BinaryblackholesystematequilibriumMarco Astorinoa,Adriano Viganòb
* Binary black hole system at equilibrium - Marco Astorinoa, Adriano Viganòb (2021)
    - Exact solution to two black holes Schwarzschild BHs.
    - Has [mathematica file](../GR_nbs/double_schwarzschild_soln) with exact metric.

* Fundamental photon orbits in the double Schwarzschild space-time (2022)
    - Photon orbits for exact space-time solution


* Effective-one-body multipolar waveforms for eccentric binary black holes with nonprecessing spins
10.1103/PhysRevD.105.044035 (2022)
    - Eff

## Useful software
* [OGRe](../GR_nbs/OGRe_documentation): An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica
    -  Very useful MTICA package for calculations in GR, such as caclulating Einstein tensor, levi-civita symbols, etc.
* [xTensor](../GR_nbs/xTensor.nb)
    - Another useful MTICA package, haven't looked into it much, but looks like it will be very useful for more advanced differential geometry applciations
* [NRPy+](https://nrpyplus.net/)
    - Python package for numerical relativity

## Projects
* [Einstein toolkit](http://einsteintoolkit.org/)
    - Have not got permission to use yet
* [SXS](https://www.black-holes.org/)
    - Sumulating extreme spacetimes

## Work done so far
* Solving einstein equation for double black hole
    - See [mathematica file](../GR_nbs/double_schwarzschild_soln.nb)
* Learning more GR
