  - Interior of a binary black hole merger (2019)
  - What Happens to Apparent Horizons in a Binary Black Hole (2021)
  - Can probe the interior of a black hole by looking at the apparent horizon

* Fundamental photon orbits in the double Schwarzschild space-time (2022)
  - Photon orbits for exact space-time solution

* Binary black hole system at equilibrium - Marco Astorinoa, Adriano Vigan√≤b (2021)
    - Exact solution to two black holes Schwarzschild BHs.
    - Has [mathematica file](../GR_nbs/double_schwarzschild_soln) with exact metric.

* Approximations for spacetime around BBHs
  - Approximate black hole binary spacetime via asymptotic matching (2013)
  - An approximate binary-black-hole metric (2000)

* Chaotic Shadows of Black Holes:  A Short Review (2022)

* Effective-one-body multipolar waveforms for eccentric binary black holes with nonprecessing spins
  10.1103/PhysRevD.105.044035 (2022)

## Useful software
* [OGRe](../GR_nbs/OGRe_documentation): An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica
    -  Very useful MTICA package for calculations in GR, such as caclulating Einstein tensor, levi-civita symbols, etc.
* [xTensor](../GR_nbs/xTensor.nb)
    - Another useful MTICA package, haven't looked into it much, but looks like it will be very useful for more advanced differential geometry applciations
* [NRPy+](https://nrpyplus.net/)
    - Python package for numerical relativity

## Projects
* [Einstein toolkit](http://einsteintoolkit.org/)
    - Have not got permission to use yet
* [SXS - Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes](https://www.black-holes.org/)

## Learning resouces
* [numerical relativity](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/the-sound-of-space-time-the-dawn-of-gravitational-wave-science/)
* [GR lectures by Frederic Schuller](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6YPgEhGKjOGKriFcF0LCJ4J8LDY3-nyR)
  - Has [lecture notes](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6b203f_dc24fe06fbe14a71ae32a1ad031e1928.pdf?index=true)
  - Good for a mathematical intro to GR

## Work done so far
* Solving einstein equation for double black hole
    - See [mathematica file](../GR_nbs/double_schwarzschild_soln.nb)
* Learning more GR

Research questions:
- What happens to a photon trapped between two event horizons
- If a particle is inbetween two black holes about to merge, does an observer at infinity see it cross both horizons?

TODO:
- [ ] Photon orbits calculation for double schwarzschild



## Questions
- [ ] Project direction
- [ ] Europe

## Meeting notes

Magnetic recombination, but for highly twisted spacetimes around merging black holes. Can particles (axions?) be ehected 
from between the black holes during a merger. Could this produce any detectable signal.

## What to do before next meeting
```latex
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate gravitational potential for metric
\item Calculate orbits for massive and massless particles
\item Show innermost stable circular orbit for each and compare them
\item Make some plots to show how the gravitational potential behaves, and stable orbits in that potential
\item Diagram to show how the location of the ISCO relative to event horizon
\item Short discussion of implications for an astrophysical black hole - why is having the ISCO different for massive/mass-less particles significant?
\end{enumerate}
```
