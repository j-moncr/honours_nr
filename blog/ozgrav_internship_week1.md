## First meeting of winter holidays

### Meeting questions

#### HR
- OzGrav internship document

#### Project questions

- No killing vector for binary black holes, due to losses from GW emissions
- No useful symmetries, only approximation schemes (what would work in our strong field region)
- How best to approximate the system?
- Only L4 and L5 stable, would reconnection occur here? Requires large mass ratio (unphysical?)

#### Progress in last two weeks

- Spent a while trying to find symmetries in the system.
- Read more about lie derivatives, killing vectors, and symmetries.
- Looked for research papers on symmetries on BH systems.
- Then looked for approximate solutions that would be applicable.
- Found paper on L4/L5 points in binary black hole systems, although it was just a classical Newtonian potential
    in a rotating frame, along with orbital distance decreasing due to GW emission.
- I added in effects due to spin precession, which resulted in L4/L5 becoming unstable more rapidly.
- Other papers later added in Kerr spacetime effects, focusing mainly on the onset of chaos of the system.


#### Meeting notes
- Particles falling towards event horizon get stuck (time dialation) meaning there is matter between two black holes
- When BBHs approach, what happens to that matter? Can it pass through L1 like in binary star systems?
- Write this up in a page, and perhaps make a map showing curvature of spacetime
